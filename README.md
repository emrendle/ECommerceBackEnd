## Installation

This project requires Node.js, Express.js, Dotenv, MySQL2, and Sequelize. The user can install these via command line by running `npm i` if the package.json file in this repository is present. The user may wish to seed the database with data before testing endpoints, in which case they can run `node seeds/index.js` to populate the database for testing.

## Usage

Once the necessary dependencies have been installed and the database has been seeded, the user can start the server by running `npm start` in the command line.
